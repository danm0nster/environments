        <p>Welcome to our
          game! <span id="players-count">X</span> people, that is
          you and <span id="players-count-minus-1">X-1</span> others,
          have joined us.</p>

        <p><strong>Your decision.</strong><br /> You will
          receive <strong>100</strong> coins per round
          for <span id="rounds-count">X</span> rounds. Each round, you
          will have to choose how many coins to put directly into your
          personal account, and how many coins to put into a group
          account.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from personal account.</strong><br /> Each
          coin that you put into your personal account each round goes
          one-to-one towards your final earnings in the game.</p>

        <p><strong>You will play in groups of four.</strong><br /> You
          will always play in a group of four, and you will be told when
          the group composition changes. Unless otherwise noted you will
          therefore play with the same players as in the previous round.</p>

        <p><strong>Return from group account.</strong><br /> Each coin
          that you and the other players in your group put into the group account
          will be summed up and multiplied by 1.5 to give the group account total.
          This total will be divided equally between the players in each group.</p>

        <p><strong>Total return.</strong><br />The total return for
          you in this game is equal to the total amount of coins earned
          over all the rounds of the game.</p>
