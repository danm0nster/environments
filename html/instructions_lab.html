          Please use this time to read the instructions that have been handed to you in paper format carefully.
        </p>        
        <p>
          Have an eye on the timer, because once it reaches zero, the game will advance automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have finished reading the instructions sheet, and have understood them, click on the bottom "Proceed to the game" below. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The next stage will be a small quiz to make sure everybody has understood the instructions correctly. You are allowed to answer the questions multiple times to find out the correct answer.
